    <h3>Chet Holmgren's stats</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>17.4 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 2.6 BPG, 54% FG, 40% 3PT</li>
    </ul>
    <span>Holmgren’s been a sniper from deep while ranking fourth in the NBA in blocks. If it weren’t for Wembanyama’s
      special
      season, Holmgren would be a runaway candidate to win Rookie of the Year. Winning the race right now, Holmgren has
      been
      much more efficient as a scorer than his lanky cohort. Plus, it’s not like Holmgren hasn’t been superb
      defensively,
      either, where he ranks tenth in the NBA in defensive win shares (1.8).</span>
    <h2 id="victor-section">2. Victor Wembanyama</h2>

      <img src="images/Victor3.jpg" width="15%" alt="Image of Victor Wembanyama" title="Victor Wembanyama Image">
    </figure>
    <h3>Victor Wembanyama's stats</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>18.9 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 3.1 BPG, 1.2 SPG, 44% FG, 29% 3PT</li>
    </ul>
    <span>Defensively, Wembanyama is a problem for any opponent he faces. Yet offensively, could still improve his
      efficiency, as
      he’s been having to take 15.8 shots per game just to average nearly 19 points per contest. That’s not ideal, but
      this is
      far from his final form. Wemby already shines the glass with the best of them, ranking second in the NBA in
      defensive
      rebounding rate at a ridiculous 30.1%.</span>
    <h2 id="jaime-section">3. Jaime Jaquez Jr.</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/JaimeJ1.jpg" width="30%" alt="Image of Jaime Jaquez Jr." title="Jaime Jaquez Jr. Image">
      <img src="images/JaimeJ2.jpg" width="15%" alt="Image of Jaime Jaquez Jr." title="Jaime Jaquez Jr. Image">
      <img src="images/JaimeJ3.jpg" width="15%" alt="Image of Jaime Jaquez Jr." title="Jaime Jaquez Jr. Image">
    </figure>
    <h3>Jaime Jaquez Jr.'s stats</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>13.8 PPG, 2.7 APG, 3.8 RPG, 1.1 SPG, 50% FG, 35% 3PT</li>
    </ul>
    <span>The 18th overall pick out of UCLA, Jaquez has quickly developed into one of the best shooters on the Miami
      Heat. Jaquez
      doesn’t hesitate to fire up shots from distance, which is exactly what the Heat need to complement the likes of
      Jimmy
      Butler and Bam Adebayo. The one they call ‘Juan Wick’ has scored in double figures in 23 of his past 26 games and
      has
      rapidly risen up NBA Rookie of the Year rankings.</span>
